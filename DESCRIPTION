Description: Simulation of Polygenic Risk Score calculations allows to 
        (1) Select an optimal p-value threshold,
        (2) Perform power analyses, and
        (3) Estimate polygenicity of a phenotype.
        Simulations are performed without direct simulations of the 
        genotype and phenotype data. 
        Instead, genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics
        are generated directly from their finite sample distributions.
